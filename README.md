# Technical Interview Practice.
---
Designed as a live coding problem repository for technical interview practice questions.

The only files that should be opened to best simulate the practice are the instructions for each problem found in the Instructions project, and the Main Method.

No function signatures should be changed. No function signatures should be deleted. 

The main should be constructed using the instructions for each problem and the Testing Class Usage section. 


### Testing Class Usage
---
The Testing class has two constructors, a default and an overload that will allow for some customization of the test cases. Parameters for the constructors will vary from problem to problem, but instructions will be provided for each problem.   

Testing your function will be done by using two functions in the Testing classes, RunForPassed and RunWithDetails.

RunForPassed will show expected results, actual results and display passed or failed.
RunWithDetails will display the testing data, and your result for each test case.

In this problem, you will be tasked with writing a function that returns the 
maximum product of three values in a list of ints.

Your function to work in is already provided in the Main, named MaxProductOfThree.

You may not modify the function signature including the return type or its parameters, but you are free to make any changes
to the body of the funciton. 

TestMaxProduct has two constructors, a default and an overload.

The default will use the default parameters of a random seed of 1, a list size of 10, a range of 20, and 10 test cases.

The overload will take a random seed, a list size, a range of numbers, and a number of test cases, in that order.

Your function will be ran in a range of negative range to positive range.

Meaning a range of 20, will produce numbers in your tests between -20 and 20.

The size of the list will be at least 3. 
If a list size is passed to the overloaded constructor that is less than 3, it will default to 3.

Here are examples of each being called in the main. 
The output from Run() will show you the test data, and the results of each test case.

new TestMaxProduct().Run();
new TestMaxProduct(1, 5, 20, 5).Run();

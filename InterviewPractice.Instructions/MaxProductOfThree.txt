In this problem, you will be tasked with writing a function that returns the maximum product of three values in a list of ints.

Insert the following function signature in the class Program in Program.cs

public static int MaxProductOfThree(List<int> argument)
{
	return 0;
}

You may not modify the function signature including the return type or its parameters, but you are free to make any changes
to the body of the funciton. 

TestMaxProduct has two constructors, a default and an overload.

The default will use the default parameters of a random seed of 1, a list size of 10, a range of 40, an offset of 20, and 10 test cases.

The overload will take a random seed, a list size, a range of numbers, and a number of test cases to try, in that order.

The formula to calculate the range of numbers your function will be run against is to take the range minus the offset.

Meaning a range of 40, and an offset of 20 will produce numbers in your tests between -20 and 20.

The size of the list will be at least 3. If a list size is passed to the overloaded constructor that is less than 3, it will default to 3.

The offset will be half of the range, such that a range of 40 will produce random numbers between -20 and 20. 

You can use either function from the TestMaxProduct class, RunForPassed(), or RunWithDetails()

RunForPassed() will provide you with the expected result, actual result, and whether or not your implementation passed.
True will represent passed, and false will represent a failure for any given test case.

RunWithDetails() will provide you the arrays used in testing, as well as your actual result for each test case.

Here are examples of each being called in the main.

new Demos.MaxProductDemo.TestMaxProduct().RunForPassed();
new Demos.MaxProductDemo.TestMaxProduct().RunWithDetails();
new Demos.MaxProductDemo.TestMaxProduct(2, 5, 20, 5).RunForPassed();
new Demos.MaxProductDemo.TestMaxProduct(1, 5, 20, 50).RunWithDetails();
